This repository documents my journey through the basics of Python, where I've explored the following fundamental concepts:

- Variables: Understanding how to store and manipulate data.
- Data Types: Exploring different types of data, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- Control Flow: Learning how to direct the flow of a program using if, else, and elif statements.
- Logical Operators: Applying logical operators (and, or, not) to make decisions in the code.
- Lists: Working with collections of data using lists, including indexing and list methods.
- Loops: Repeating tasks efficiently using for and while loops.
- Functions: Creating reusable blocks of code to perform specific tasks with defined inputs and outputs.
